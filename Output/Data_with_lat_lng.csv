158,Data Scientist,Custoria,"Data science is the core around which Custora is built. The central value proposition of our product is that we provide e-commerce businesses the ability to:

organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with
analyze it for patterns and predictions
deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way
and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door
The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.

We place particular emphasis on providing a robust system of statistical insights. Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation’s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn’t even thought of.

On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we’ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we’re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.
Specifically, we are looking for:

A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.
Experience with at least two programming languages and one general-purpose statistical package or programming library. The data science team mainly uses R, Scala, and Ruby, but that’s not set in stone, and we value the ability to learn new libraries and ecosystems.
Friendly and ready to work with others, both technical and non-technical. We don’t work in isolation and regularly interact with each other and members of other teams.
At least some familiarity with: Unix-like operating systems, SQL databases, and web application programming. Strong experience in any is a plus.
Other pluses: experience with distributed-computing ecosystems like Spark; experience with Amazon Web Services; experience teaching statistics or programming

On Monday we eat and meet as a team to chat projects and progress.
We’re 45 genuinely nice people. We work together and experiment with how to do things. It’s an amazing environment to both explore your professional interests and shape your career trajectory.
We move quickly. You build something and the next day it comes to life. You see and feel an immediate impact with the collective efforts of the team.

270,Data Scientist,Bold Metrics,"WHO WE ARE
Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.
We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the world’s largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

298,Data Scientist,States Title,"********************************************
Create the model that transforms an industry
********************************************

Want to bring a $15B sector of the insurance industry into the 21st century? Yearning for a startup built around machine learning? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs title insurance. The current incumbents pay only 5% of their intake as claims; they spend about 85% running a manual process that involves frequent paper searches and phone calls for millions of mortgages every year.

States Title is modernizing this antiquated process and will scale rapidly to grab a large fraction of the market. By bringing data science to title insurance, we can repurpose those wasted billions towards making homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

*************************************************
We're growing our data science team at all levels
*************************************************

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun, diverse, and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at The White House, Google, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

**************************
Do you have what it takes?
**************************


2-10 years of relevant experience in any of the following:
Fintech: you've built credit risk, fraud, or insurance models or algorithms and worked with engineering teams to deploy them
Academia: you've used real-world data to publish highly cited peer-reviewed journal articles on prediction or inference using open source tools
Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models
Strengths aligned with our needs
Theoretical background relevant to data science (e.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?)
Technical skills (e.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?)
Creative skills (e.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?)
Collaboration skills (e.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?)
In-person, full-time availability
You live in or are willing to relocate to the SF Bay Area
You thrive on in-person interaction and look forward to getting in to work
